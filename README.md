| **1. Base ROI Model Setup**                              | Import ROI data (`roi_company1.csv`) and define the piecewise constant ROI functions for each marketing medium. Visualize total return as a piecewise linear function of investment. | `marketing_allocation.ipynb` |         |      | Include a `pd.read_csv(...)` call clearly commented at top.              |
| **2. Linear Program (LP) – Concave ROI Case**            | Formulate and solve the marketing allocation as a **linear program** using Gurobi under the assumption of concave ROI (non-increasing returns).                                      | `marketing_allocation.ipynb` |         |      | Maximize total return subject to a $10M budget and platform constraints. |
| **2a. Managerial Constraints**                           | Implement the CMO’s constraints: (1) Print+TV ≤ Facebook+Email, (2) Social ≥ 2×(SEO+AdWords), (3) Investment ≤ $3M per platform.                                                     | `marketing_allocation.ipynb` |         |      | Verify constraint feasibility before solving.                            |
| **3. Mixed Integer Program (MIP) – Nonconcave ROI Case** | Replace the LP with a **mixed integer program** to handle non-monotonic ROI data (`roi_company2.csv`). Introduce binary tier-selection variables for each medium.                    | `marketing_allocation.ipynb` |         |      | Each tier’s activation controlled by binary variables.                   |
| **4. Cross-Evaluation**                                  | Compare allocations from both firms’ ROI data. Evaluate objective loss when each allocation is applied to the other firm’s ROI estimates.                                            | `marketing_allocation.ipynb` |         |      | Quantify robustness and interpret managerial implications.               |
| **5. Minimum Investment Thresholds**                     | Add binary constraints using `min_amount.csv` so each medium is either uninvested or receives ≥ its minimum effective spend.                                                         | `marketing_allocation.ipynb` |         |      | Re-solve MIP with these additional thresholds.                           |
| **6. Dynamic Reinvestment Model**                        | Allow 50% reinvestment of monthly returns (e.g., 4% ROI → +0.2M next month). Use `roi_monthly.csv` to compute monthly optimal allocations.                                           | `marketing_allocation.ipynb` |         |      | Re-optimize monthly budget given compounding returns.                    |
| **7. Stability Check**                                   | Assess whether monthly allocations are “stable” — i.e., no platform’s budget changes by more than ±$1M month-to-month.                                                               | `marketing_allocation.ipynb` |         |      | If unstable, describe how to enforce stability in future MIP.            |
| **8. Visualization and Reporting**                       | Generate clear visuals of ROI tiers, optimal allocation, and comparative returns. Summarize findings in a professionally written report.                                             | `marketing_report.pdf`       |         |      | Include graphs, explanation, and embedded code screenshots.              |
| **9. Generalized Code Verification**                     | Ensure no hard-coded numeric values. All computations reference dataframe variables so TA can re-run with new CSVs.                                                                  | `marketing_allocation.ipynb` |         |      | Failure to generalize = 10% automatic penalty.                           |
| **10. Final Submission**                                 | Submit `marketing_allocation.ipynb` and `marketing_report.pdf` to Canvas. Include graphs, commentary, and results for all models.                                                    |                              |         |      | 66% grade = correctness, 34% = quality of analysis.                      |
